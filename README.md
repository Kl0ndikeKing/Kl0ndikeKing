### Hey, I'm P. McD0nald ⛏️

Data extraction engineer. I build scrapers that don't break.

#### What I Do

I develop **production-ready web scrapers** and data extraction tools, mainly on the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/klondikeking). My focus:

- **Review platforms** — Trustpilot, G2, Capterra, and more
- **E-commerce data** — pricing, inventory, product catalogs
- **Business intelligence** — company data, job listings, market research

Every Actor I ship is tested, documented, and built to handle edge cases at scale.

#### Tech Stack

```
TypeScript · Node.js · Crawlee · Cheerio · Playwright · Python
```

#### My Actors

| Actor | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| [Trustpilot Reviews Scraper](https://apify.com/klondikeking/trustpilot-reviews-scraper) | Extract reviews, ratings, authors from any Trustpilot page |
| *More coming soon...* | |

#### Philosophy

> *"Every data point is a gold nugget waiting to be mined."*

I don't build throwaway scripts. I build tools that teams rely on daily. Clean inputs, clean outputs, predictable behavior.
